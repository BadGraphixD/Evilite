# Evilite
A Unity 2D metroidvania game, themed around an evil artefact/stone.

The project was started about a year ago, but got to a halt. Now I've renamed it to 'Evilite' (previously 'The Evolid') and started from scratch to improve the overall code structure, performance and to make the project accessible to everyone.

### Changes from old Project
+ New name
+ Better save/load system
+ Better code structure
+ More focus on NPCs
+ Aimed to have modding support

### Project Info
+ Unity, C#
+ 2D metroidvania game
